#+TITLE: Crossbow

A dynamic, interactive programming language.

Solve problems with arrows.

* TODO
- [ ] good tests
- [ ] Character-by-character interface
- [ ] intermediate state display by default
- [X] Pipe one thing to another
- [ ] easy collection literals
- [ ] Loose laws about what thing can pass to another; very dynamic type system
- [ ] Shortcuts for referring to output of previous line / assignment
- [X] Basic arithmetic
- [ ] Functoriality by default (e.g. [1,2,3] + 1 fmaps the addition)
- [X] Single pipes
- [ ] Display pipe result, truncated, in real time
- [ ] easy file input
- [ ] parsing as default
- [ ] huge standard library of things
  - search functions
  - algorithms
  - countmap
  - bitwise stuff
- [ ] use AOC as a testbed, are there tiny solutions to each part of each day?
- [ ] simple precedence; no parens. arrows instead
- [ ] variable allocation
- [ ] function definition
- [ ] interpreted multiline functions
- [ ] native terminal colors (see tetris, no curses)
- [ ] kb shortcuts for skipping between clauses
