/Solving the first day of Advent of Code 2021 two ways using Crossbow/

* Features

- Haskell, APL and POSIX inspired.
- Forking pipeline style: ~1:10 | filter even | sum~ or ~filter (even) (sum 1:10)~
- Encouraged to model with forks and joins: e.g. ~{$0|fork 2|[length,id]|[range 0, id]|monadic zip}~ is the ~enum~ function, where ~enum 1:10~ is ~[[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,8],[8,9],[9,10]]~
- Dynamic typing: ~[1, "hi", [True]]~ is valid. Yes, that means runtime errors.
- Applicative by default: ~[+1,+2]|[3,4]~ is ~[4,6]~
- Lambdas: ~{$0|sum|(_+$1)}|1:10|5~ is ~60~
- Curried functions by default
  - Can be uncurried - made ~monadic~ (i.e. single-argument; in the APL sense of monadic) - e.g. ~[[1,2],[3,4]] | map (monadic +)~ is ~[3, 7]~
- Partial application in any position with ~_~ placeholder: ~foldl _ 0 1:10 | +~ is ~55~
- ~aoc~ builtin for loading Advent of Code input :)
